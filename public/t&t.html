           <h2> Best Ways to Get There  </h2>
           <img src="media/airplane1.jpg" id="panorama">
           <p>
             There are now tons of cheap ways to get
             around Europe because of all these changes.
             By far one of the cheapest ways to travel
             long-distance in Europe is by budget airline.
             These airlines are hugely prolific on the continent,
              and this competition has led to incredibly cheap
              fares, often as cheap as 1 euro. When I need to go
              somewhere and I don’t want to take a long bus or
              train journey, I fly budget airlines. My favorite
              budget airlines are:
              <ul>
                <li>Ryanair</li>
                <li>Wow Air</li>
                <li>Norwegian Air</li>
                <li>Wizz Air</li>
              </ul>
              Other option, that I prefer, is travelling by train.
              And the European rail system is one of the best and most
              extensive in the world.
              If you’re going to travel by train, it’s hard to
               beat them on price and convenience for short
               city-to-city travel. For longer journeys
               (overnight journeys, between countries, or rides
               that require a high-speed line, like Paris to
               Bordeaux or Berlin to Munich), trains tend to be
               very expensive.
               <p>
                 Also, if you are planning a longer journey, you can get
               an Interrail Flex Pass. You can write the ID
               and hour of your train on ticket as soon as you are in it. This way
               you will never miss a train or waste a day of your pass.

           <h2> Accommodation </h2>
           <p>
             Where you sleep at night is one of your major fixed travel
             expenses, so learning how to find cheap accommodation will
             help you to keep more money in your pocket for spending on
             activities.
           </p>
           There is no point finding cheap hotel accommodation
           if it is miles out of town and you have
           to pay extra in transportation costs.Stay in a central
           rea close to public transport, airports, local
            attractions, food outlets, the beach, the park,
            and the ability to get out and walk to most things.
           <p>
             Are hotels cheaper in different seasons? Of course!<br>
             One of the obvious tips on how to find cheap accommodation is
             by travelling in the shoulder season, that time
             period between the peak and off-peak season.
           </p>
           <p>
             One of my recomandations is to try Airbnb. <br>
             These properties allow travelers to trade in the
             cookie-cutter hotel experience for one that offers
             colleagues a unique and comfortable space in which
             to connect and collaborate.

           <h2> Finding Great Views</h2>
           <img src="media/panorama.jpg" id="panorama">
           <p>If you want to «travel far away» while staying in
              Europe, the best idea is to discover the most
              beautiful landscapes in Europe. Discover the
              most beautiful European landscapes with the Cote d'Azur
              but also the wonderful Navagio in Zakynthos, Greece.
              You probably already know about the Burano and Murano
              islands in Venice, Italy,but what about The Blue
              Lagoon, from Split, Croatia?
           </p>
           <p>
             Come and discover the carpets of blue bell of wild
             hyacinths covering the wood of Hallerbos in Hal
             (Flemish Brabant), close to Brussels. This beautiful
             forest is famous for the beautiful wild hyacinths that
             bloom at the end of April or the beginning of May.
           </p>
           <p>
             Mount Etna is certainly the most famous volcano
             in Europe It is located in Catania (Sicily). It
             is the largest volcano in Europe culminating at
             3300 meters.  Etna is not as quiet as you think with
              more than 100 eruptions in 100 years; it is one of
              the most active volcanoes in the world.
           </p>
           <p>The Plitvice lakes National Park are ranked at
              the top of the most beautiful parks in Europe.
              Treat yourself to a day trip to the Plitvice Lakes
              National Park, a city trip to Zagreb or a relaxing
              holiday in Zadar. These 16 large lakes, connected by
              nearly 100 waterfalls, are dazzlingly blue.

           <h2> Traditional Food and Drinks</h2>
           <h3>Pizza</h3>
             <img src="media/it.jpg" id="food">
             <p>
             There are few countries as well-known for great
             cuisine as Italy. And while there’s more to Italian
             food than just pizza and pasta, you’ve still got to
             try the original. It seems most cities in Italy are
             competing for the best pizza, but really, you’ve got
             to try it in Naples if you can. Oh, and while you’re
             in Italy — might as well get your fill of gelato, too!
           </p>
           <h3>Crepes</h3>
          <img src="media/fr.jpg" id="food">
          <p>
             Besides baguettes, there’s nothing more French than
             a crepe—savoury or sweet. The best crepes are the
             simplest ones and can be found throughout France —
             we like the ones with Nutella on the inside!
           </p>
           <h3>Beer </h3>
            <img src="media/be.jpg" id="food">
            <p>
             Okay, so beer isn’t a food. But if you’ve been to
             Belgium, you’ll know that beer is practically a meal
            here. In a country with over 150 different breweries,
            Belgium is spoiled for choice in types of beer.
            Belgium tourism has a handy guide to the many
            different beer breweries, festivals and tours on
            their website.

           <h3>Pierogi</h3>
          <img src="media/pl.jpg" id="food">
           <p>
           It seems every culture in the world has some sort of
           dumplings dish and in Poland, it’s called a pierogi.
           They come in hundreds of varieties, but most
           traditionally they’re baked or fired in butter with
           onions — and almost always served with sauerkraut!
           They can be vegetarian (in Poland, that means potatoes)
           or with ground meat. Entire restaurants are dedicated to
           pierogi!
         </p>
         <h3>Galaktoboureko</h3>
          <img src="media/gr.jpg" id="food">
          <p>
             Galaktoboureko is a great Greek dessert with
             crispy perfection. Take a mouthful bite of
             Galaktoboureko and let your mouth be filled with
            its juices. This age old Greek dessert is made of
            crispy phyllo sprinkled with melted butter. Greeks
            use the most creamy custard & scented syrup to
            increase the taste of this food by many folds.
